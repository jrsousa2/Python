### Personal Python projects developed in VS Code

**Various projects that I've developed in Python, including:**
- AI video enhancement

- Upward pitch shifting of speech (baby voice)
- Play counts syncing between iTunes and Windows Media Player
- Search, download and attachment of MP3 artwork (Apple or Discogs)
- Searching and populating MP3 tags on the Discogs website automatically
- Downloading of videos from Youtube (use "YT-DLP CMD LINE.txt" to see command line usage, since Youtube credentials may be needed and can be taken from cookies)
- Creation of stand-alone/static executables from Python codes
- Fitting statistical models such as Logistics Regression using ML for parameter and goodness-of-fit optimization (in progress)
- Web scraping of tables on Wikipedia with BeautifulSoup
