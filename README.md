### Personal Python projects developed in VS Code

**Various projects that I've developed in Python, including:**
- AI video enhancement
- Speech recognition and transcripting / translation (PT to EN)
- Upward pitch shifting of speech (baby voice)
- Play counts syncing between iTunes and Windows Media Player
- Moving MP3 files under their right folder and creating complete log files with changes.
- Search, download and attachment of MP3 artwork (Apple or Discogs), with log files creation.
- Searching and populating MP3 tags on the Discogs website automatically
- Making MP3 tag names in sync with the actual file names (to detect and resolve conflicts)
- Downloading of videos from Youtube (use "YT-DLP CMD LINE.txt" to see command line usage, as Youtube credentials may be needed and are taken from browser cookies). 
- Download video codes will only work if the video doesn't requires credentials. The command line works always (install module yt-dlp).
- Creation of stand-alone/static executables from Python codes
- Fitting statistical models such as Logistics Regression using ML for parameter and goodness-of-fit optimization (in progress)
- Web scraping of tables on Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup
- Automatic creation of formatted PPT slides with data scraped from Wikipedia (see final video below)
- Image, audio and video processing using ffmpeg
