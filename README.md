### Personal Python projects developed in VS Code

**Various projects that I've developed in Python, including:**
- AI video enhancement with open source code Real-ESRGAN (this is ML/DL*).
- Checking if NVIDIA's CUDA is enabled after installation.
- Speech recognition and transcription/translation (PT to EN) (this is ML/DL).
- Automatic creation of subtitle file (.srt) from transcribed\translated audio. [Ana Paula](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B6sfs_E2MWkTN-DnnCS2a-nTI4polJzJ/view?usp=sharing)
- Upward pitch shifting of speech (baby voice). This is ML/DL.
- Play counts syncing between iTunes and Windows Media Player.
- Moving MP3 files under their right folder and creating complete log files with changes.
- Search, download and attachment of MP3 artwork (Apple or Discogs), with log files creation.
- Image pattern recognition (trying to check if an MP3 cover is a generic vinyl/LP so it can be automatically replaced).<br> 
This is done by comparing the cover with a given vinyl image. This is ML/DL.
- Searching and populating MP3 tags on the Discogs website automatically.
- Making MP3 tag names in sync with the actual file names (to detect and resolve conflicts)
- Downloading of videos from Youtube (use "YT-DLP CMD LINE.txt" to see command line usage, as Youtube credentials may be needed and are taken from browser cookies). 
- Download video codes will only work if the video doesn't requires credentials. The command line works always (install module yt-dlp).
- Creation of stand-alone/static executables from Python codes.
- Fitting statistical models such as Logistics Regression using ML for parameter and goodness-of-fit optimization (in progress).
- Web scraping of tables on Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup.
- Automatic creation of formatted PPT slides with data scraped from Wikipedia (see final video below).
- Calling function by passing another function as parameter and feeding variables to it from called function with lambda.
- Image, audio and video processing using ffmpeg.
- Submitting windows commands from Python.
