| **Type**    | **Explanation**                                                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int       | Integer numbers, whole numbers without a decimal point (e.g., 42, -7).                                   |
| float     | Floating-point numbers, numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).                                      |
| complex   | Complex numbers with a real and imaginary part; represented as a + bj where j is the imaginary unit. |
| bool      | Boolean type representing truth values: True or False.                                               |
| str       | Strings, sequences of characters used for text (e.g., "hello").                                        |
| tuple     | Immutable ordered sequence of elements (can be mixed types), e.g., (1, 2, 3).                          |
| frozenset | Immutable version of a set, an unordered collection of unique elements that cannot be changed.           |
| bytes     | Immutable sequence of bytes, used for binary data (e.g., file content, network data).                    |
| list      | Mutable ordered sequence of elements, can be changed by adding, removing, or modifying items.            |
| set       | Mutable unordered collection of unique elements, useful for fast membership tests and operations.        |
| dict      | Mutable collection of key-value pairs (a mapping), e.g., {"a": 1, "b": 2}.                             |
| bytearray | Mutable sequence of bytes, similar to bytes but can be modified.                                       |
