MapReduce was created by Google in 2004.

Hadoop was inspired by Google's MapReduce and HDFS (Google File System).

Hadoop was later developed by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella, based on Google's ideas.

Hadoop is a distributed data storage & batch processing app.

Hadoop is used with MapReduce. 

HDFS is Hadoop's native file system. Spark can use it too.

Apache Spark was designed to do in-memory distributed data processing, making it much faster for many workloads, especially iterative algorithms and interactive queries.
